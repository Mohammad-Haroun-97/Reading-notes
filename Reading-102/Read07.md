# Functions    

![Java script!](https://elzero.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/learning-javascript.png)
***In JavaScript, functions are one of the most basic building elements. In JavaScript, a function is comparable to a procedure—a sequence of words that performs a task or calculates a value—but a process must accept some input and provide an output with some clear link between the input and the output to qualify as a function. To utilize a function, you must first define it.***

# Defining functions
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

1. The name of the function.
2. A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
3. The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.    

# Function expressions
While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression.

Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function square could have been defined as:

const square = function(number) { return number * number }
var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16

# Calling functions    

The act of defining a function does not imply that it will be executed. Defining it gives the function a name and tells it what to perform when it's called.

The function is called, and the stated actions are carried out using the supplied arguments.
