*** many significant parts of ControlÂ Version :***
* *Local Version Control*

Local Version Control systems were invented by programmers many years ago. A Local VCS is a database that stores changes to files on your hard drive.
* *Centralized Version Control*    

The Centralized Version Control System was created in response to the necessity for cooperation within a developer team on a single file or collection of files (CVCS). This system consists of a single server that stores all modifications and file versions and is accessible by multiple clients. 

* *Distributed Version Control*  

The fundamental weakness of CVS is the server as a single point of failure, which is addressed by a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). When a CVS is down, participants are unable to collaborate on a file together or save changes and new versions. 



# Definition of Git  
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that saves data in a snapshot-based file system. Git produces a snapshot of the file and keeps a reference to it every time you commit a revised version of your project. Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of the file if it hasn't changed.

Furthermore, here some cental featuers of Git : 
### 1.  Local Operations  
Because the majority of essential information may be obtained in local resources, Git mostly depends on local activities.   
### 2.  Tracking Changes

### 3.  Loss of Data

### 4.  States
