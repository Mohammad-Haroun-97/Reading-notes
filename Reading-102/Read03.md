# Wireframe and Design
Wireframing is a UX design technique that helps designers to establish and organize the information hierarchy of a website, app, or product. Based on the user research conducted by the UX design team, this approach focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to digest information on a site.

When designing for the screen, you must first determine where all of the data will be shown.
## How to make your wireframe in six steps
***1. Do your research***  

Remember: UX design is a process, and wireframing isn’t the first step in this process. Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, creating user personas and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research

***2. Prepare your research for quick reference***    

You can imagine how much quantitative and qualitative data those various phases will produce. Well, that’s what you need to keep in mind while drawing out your wireframes. If you’re a mere mortal,  
***3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out***  

Your wireframing is going to get very messy very quickly if you don’t have an idea of how many screens you’ll need to produce and the flow you expect the user to follow.    

***4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate***  

Ok, now we’re on step four and you can finally start putting pen to paper. Sorry it’s taken this long, but the previous steps were critical: The old adage that you should look before you leap is 100% relevant to UX.  

***5. Add some detail and get testing***  

So you have a flow and you have your screens, and you’ve corroborated your ideas with some clued-up colleagues. The next step is to add some informational details to prepare your wireframe for its upgrade, Megatron-style, to prototype-mode.

***6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes***    


Once you’ve documented and acted upon the feedback from your first prototype, you can start developing your high-fidelity prototypes.


# HTML basics
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the coding that used for a web page's structure and content. Content might be organized using a collection of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or pictures and data tables.HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller   

### HTML example
My cat is very grumpy  
  
  
If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:  
  

<p>My cat is very grumpy<p>

 ## The main parts of our element are as follows:

* The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to
* take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
* The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where * the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
* The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
* The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
  
  ## Empty elements
Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page:
    
  
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"....>  
  
Copy to Clipboard  
  
This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.       

# Semantics

In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have"  
# Semantics in JavaScript  

In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

# Semantics in CSS  
  
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

# Semantics in HTML  
  
In HTML, for example,***the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."***
