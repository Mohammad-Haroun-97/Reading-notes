# JavaScript     

JavaScript (JS) is a first-class compiled programming language that is lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled. While JavaScript is best known as a scripting language for Web pages, it is also used in a variety of non-browser contexts, including Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded language that supports object-oriented, imperative programming.

# JavaScript Variables

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword

### Example :  

var x = 5;  

var y = 6;  

var z = x + y;  


# JavaScript Identifiers  
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter
* Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names    

# JavaScript Arithmetic  

As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:

### Example
var x = 5 + 2 + 3;
