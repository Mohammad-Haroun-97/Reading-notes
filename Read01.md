  ## Markdown  

Markdown provides ***a lightweight and simple syntax for styling various types of writing***. Markdown is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the document appears; bolding or italicizing text, inserting photos, and generating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
  
  Most sites on GitHub allow you to utilize Markdown:
  * Gists
  * Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
  * Files with the .md or .markdown extension

 Now I will clarify it by showing you some **EXAMPLES**, by showing below the word ASAC in bold, link, heading, italic and in link   
 
 BOLD : **ASAC**  
 
 ITALIC : *ASAC*  
 
 
 
 LINK: [ASAC](https://duckduckgo.com)   
 
 you can insert an image also as it is shown below

## GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub.com employs its own version of the Markdown format, which includes a number of handy features that make working with content on the site easier.

It's worth noting that some GitHub Flavored Markdown capabilities are only available in Issue and Pull Request descriptions and comments. @mentions, as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests, are examples. Tas

## Username @mentions

Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.
