Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to â€œmockâ€ an API for development like json-server
-nock:    https://opencollective.com/nock
-mock-server : https://www.mock-server.com/

# Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

Swagger is similar to Postman. you can create request in the swagger site, you will see the console.logs in your terminal when that request is ran
APIdoc.js is a node module that "creates a documentation from API descriptions in your source"

# Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
## SOAP 
(Simple Object Access Protocol) which delivers messages using XML (extensible mark up language) and does not require the use of HTTP which REST does.
## ReST
stands for representational state transfer like the GET, PUT, POST, DELETE HTTP request verbs

The body contains information that is being sent to the server ("payload"). Examples of information sent to the server may include form data.
