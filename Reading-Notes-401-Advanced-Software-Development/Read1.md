# How to Solve Programming Problems 
The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible. 
You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it. 
Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

## simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.
* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

## Read the problem completely twice 
* You want to make sure you completely understand the problem
* A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

## Solve the problem manually

* It is very important to solve the problem manually first
* solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.
* you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.  You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head.  You want to be aware of each step, it is easy to gloss over them.

## Optimize the manual solution

It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.

## Write pseudo-code or comments
If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.

## Replace comments with real code
* This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.
* All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.
* If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

1-You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
2-You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

If you don’t know your programming language well enough to do the translation, you may need to brush up here on some basic constructs.  Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

* Create a list
* Sort a list or array
* Create a map or dictionary
* Loop through a list, or dictionary
* Parse strings
* Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

## Optimize the real code
* Sometimes this step isn’t necessary
* This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.
* important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do


# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

* The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.

* Do not give your talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.
* “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness
* Being busy is a form of mental laziness.
* People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable
* As You Think, So You Are
* If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.
* Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and people will begin to treat it like that, too.
* The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything 
* Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.


# How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
* Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.
* it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.
* Bad way to Solve prople : 
1-Try a solution.
2-If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3-If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

* Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.

* Everyone is different. You’ll be different. But if you start with principles we all agree are good, you’ll get a lot further a lot quicker.

* The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.

## So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand

* Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them 
* How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
* you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it 
* “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.

2. Plan

* Don’t dive right into solving without a plan 

* Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps
* Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
* To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

3. Divide

* Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
*  break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
*  Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (
* simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
* Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
* This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving


4. Stuck
* The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.
* Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging
* Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
* Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.


5. Practice 

* this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”
* practicing “micro problem-solving.”
* try to solve at least one challenge 

# 5 Whys

Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly
* Have you ever had a problem that refused to go away? No matter what you did, sooner or later it would return, perhaps in another form.
* The 5 Whys technique is true to this tradition, and it is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the process or problem in question.
* The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.
* You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
* It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem. This is because 5 Whys can lead you to pursue a single track, 

## How to Use the 5 Whys
1. Assemble a Team
* Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.
2. Define the Problem
* If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on
3. Ask the First "Why?"
* Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
* Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
