## AWS: S3 and Lambda ===

## You can use Lambda to process event notifications from Amazon Simple Storage Service. Amazon S3 can send an event to a Lambda function when an object is created or deleted. You configure notification settings on a bucket, and grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke a function on the function’s resource-based permissions policy.

## Amazon S3 invokes your function asynchronously with an event that contains details about the object. The following example shows an event that Amazon S3 sent when a deployment package was uploaded to Amazon S3.

## Describe “The Cloud”
The cloud refers to servers accessed over the internet that store resources and software for computing and data storage.

## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is like a bundle containing an application and everything it needs to run.

## What is auto-scaling?
A cloud computing feature that allows cloud services to automatically scale based on traffic and utilization.

## What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is how much data can be transferred by an entity such as a network or hardware.

## How do cloud providers compute service costs? They charge based on the amount of usage of their services.
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Server Instances A single instance of a server when it is run on a machine or virtual machine

Containers A self contained environment that contains an application and all of its dependencies.

Cloud Services Services provided by a cloud service provider such as computing resources and data storage.

Cloud Architecture All of the cloud services used in a project such as databases and computing resources.

AWS Amazon Web Services - a major cloud service provider

## EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku EC2/Beanstalk is AWS’s infrastructure solution for deploying software. Heroku is built off of these services and is more user friendly in my opinion.
